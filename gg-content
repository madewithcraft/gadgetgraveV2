Gadget Grave is a small, employee owned and operated, company with big ideas. We are a tight knit environmentally conscious group who think we can make a small difference in the world. For example did you know that cellphones and gadgets can leach toxic chemicals into the ground like arsenic, lead, cadmium, and beryllium? Did you know that for every tossed battery pack, several thousand gallons of water are polluted? Cellphones and gadgets have become a way of life for us, we love them! Throughout 97% of our life we have a gadget or some kind of electronic device less than 5 feet away from our body. The sad part is that our loved devices won’t last forever, sometimes they succumb to accidents, and sometimes to years of normal wear-and-tear. When these things happen, we can do a few things to help the environment: 1. Give them new life by repairing them. 2. Give them a proper burial by responsible recycling. 3. Fix them up and donate them to a charity organization. Contact Us Today!
