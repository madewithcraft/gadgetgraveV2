						p We have a price list on hand to be able to give repair quotes over the phone. Our technicians are always on hand if you need to call and get an idea of the cost to fix your broken phone. If we do not have the part in stock, we have several suppliers ready to send parts overnight. The parts generally arrive before noon. This means that the device will be repaired within 24 hours of it being dropped off. We strive to have the quickest turnaround times of any repair facility in our region.
